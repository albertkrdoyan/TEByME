To combine a **top-docked search bar** with a **movable floating window**, you could implement the following design:  

1. **Default Behavior**:  
   Place the search and replace bar docked at the top of the text editor by default. It should include fields for "Find" and "Replace" with buttons like "Next," "Previous," "Replace," and "Replace All."  +++++++++++++++++

2. **Undocking Option**:  
   Add a "Pop Out" or "Undock" button to the docked search bar. When clicked, it detaches the search bar into a movable, floating window that users can drag anywhere in the app.  ++++++++++++++

3. **Custom Position Memory**:  
   Allow the floating window to remember its last position. If the user closes and reopens it, it should reappear where they left it.  ++++++++++++

4. **Dynamic Behavior**:  
   When the floating window is dragged back near the top of the app, snap it back to the docked position (optional but user-friendly).  

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:  
   Ensure keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+F`/`Ctrl+H`) open the search bar, whether docked or floating, so it's accessible in both modes.  +++++++++++++

This hybrid approach offers both convenience and flexibility, catering to different user preferences. Would you like help implementing the undocking feature?
